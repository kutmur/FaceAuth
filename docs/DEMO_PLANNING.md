## Demo Scripts

### Script 1: Quick Start Demo (5 minutes)

**Timing**: 5 minutes total
**Audience**: General users, first-time viewers
**Focus**: Ease of use and basic functionality

#### Pre-Demo Setup (30 seconds)
```
[Terminal ready, camera connected, clean workspace]

Narrator: "Let's see how FaceAuth makes file security as simple as looking at your camera. This is a completely local system - no cloud, no data sharing, complete privacy."
```

#### Scene 1: System Check (30 seconds)
```bash
# Command to run
python main.py system-check

# Narrator script:
"First, let's verify our system is ready. FaceAuth checks camera access, 
security settings, and ensures everything is properly configured."

# Expected output highlights:
✅ Python version: 3.11.0
✅ Camera access: Available
✅ Storage directory: Created
✅ Security: Configured
```

#### Scene 2: Face Enrollment (2 minutes)
```bash
# Command to run
python main.py enroll-face demo-user

# Narrator script:
"Now let's enroll a user. This creates a mathematical representation 
of facial features - never storing actual photos. The entire process 
happens locally on your device."

# Key points to highlight:
- Camera opens automatically
- Real-time face detection
- Quality assessment feedback
- Progress indicators
- Completion confirmation

# Expected interaction:
[Camera opens]
[Position face in frame]
[Wait for enrollment completion]
[Success message displayed]
```

#### Scene 3: File Encryption (1.5 minutes)
```bash
# Create sample file first
echo "This is a confidential document with sensitive information." > confidential.txt

# Command to run
python main.py encrypt-file confidential.txt demo-user

# Narrator script:
"Let's encrypt a confidential file. FaceAuth uses military-grade 
encryption tied to your face - only you can decrypt it."

# Key points to highlight:
- Face authentication required
- Strong encryption (AES-256)
- Original file can be safely deleted
- Encrypted file is unreadable without authentication

# Show encrypted file
cat confidential.txt.encrypted
# (Should show garbled encrypted data)
```

#### Scene 4: File Decryption (1 minute)
```bash
# Command to run
python main.py decrypt-file confidential.txt.encrypted demo-user

# Narrator script:
"To access our file, we need face authentication again. 
This proves identity and decrypts the file in one step."

# Key points to highlight:
- Face authentication prompt
- Quick recognition (1-3 seconds)
- File successfully decrypted
- Content is readable again

# Show decrypted content
cat confidential.txt
```

#### Conclusion (30 seconds)
```
# Cleanup
python main.py delete-user demo-user --force

# Narrator script:
"That's FaceAuth - privacy-first file security that's as simple as 
looking at your camera. Local processing, military-grade encryption, 
and complete user control over their data."
```

manager = FaceEnrollmentManager()
authenticator = FaceAuthenticator()

# Enroll user programmatically
result = manager.enroll_user("api_user", timeout=30)
print(f"Enrollment result: {result}")

# Authenticate user
auth_result = authenticator.authenticate("api_user")
print(f"Authentication: {auth_result}")
```

#### Scene 2: File Operations API (5 minutes)
```python
# File encryption/decryption through API
from faceauth.utils.file_crypto import FileEncryption

crypto = FileEncryption()

# Encrypt file
crypto.encrypt_file("sensitive.docx", "api_user", "encrypted_file.bin")

# Decrypt file (requires authentication)
crypto.decrypt_file("encrypted_file.bin", "api_user", "recovered.docx")
```

#### Scene 3: Web Integration (5 minutes)
```python
# Flask web app integration
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from faceauth import FaceAuthenticator

app = Flask(__name__)
auth = FaceAuthenticator()

@app.route('/api/authenticate', methods=['POST'])
def authenticate():
    user_id = request.json['user_id']
    result = auth.authenticate_realtime(user_id, timeout=10)
    return jsonify(result)

# Demo the web interface

This creates a mathematical representation - never storing actual photos."

[Completion message]
Narrator: "Enrollment complete! John is now registered in the system."
```

**File Encryption (3m-4m)**
```
[Screen: File creation]
Narrator: "Let's create a confidential document and encrypt it."

[File creation and encryption]
$ echo "Confidential project data" > secret.txt
$ python main.py encrypt-file secret.txt john-demo

[Face authentication prompt]
Narrator: "FaceAuth requires face authentication to encrypt the file. 
This ensures only authorized users can create encrypted content."

[Show encrypted file]
$ cat secret.txt.encrypted
Narrator: "The file is now encrypted with military-grade AES-256 encryption. 
Without face authentication, this data is completely unreadable."
```

**File Decryption (4m-4m30s)**
```
