python main.py config-set camera_resolution "640x480"

# Fine-tune for your hardware
python main.py config-set use_gpu true  # If you have GPU
```

#### Security Settings
```bash
# Set strong security level
python main.py config-set security_level high

# Configure data retention
python main.py config-set default_retention_days 365

# Enable comprehensive logging
python main.py config-set audit_logging true
```

## üé® Integration Ideas

### Personal Use Cases
- **Secure Documents**: Medical records, legal documents, tax files
