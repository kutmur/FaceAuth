   - Camera will activate automatically

2. **Position Yourself**
   - Ensure good lighting conditions
   - Center your face in the camera view
   - Wait for green rectangle around detected face

3. **Capture Face**
   - Press SPACE when face is clearly visible
   - System will extract and save facial features
   - Confirmation message will appear

4. **Completion**
   - Face encoding saved securely to disk
   - Ready for authentication operations

#### Face Authentication Process

1. **Start Authentication**
   - Click "üîê Authenticate Face"
   - Camera preview will open

2. **Face Verification**
   - Position face similar to enrollment
   - Press SPACE to capture current image
   - System compares with enrolled face template

3. **Results**
   - **Success**: Green checkmark, file operations enabled
   - **Failure**: Red X, authentication required to continue
   - Confidence percentage displayed for successful matches

#### File Encryption Workflow

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Must be authenticated (green checkmark visible)
   - Have a file ready to encrypt

2. **Select File**
   - Click "üîí Encrypt File"
   - File dialog opens for selection
   - Choose any file type

3. **Encryption Process**
   - System generates encryption key from facial features
   - File is encrypted using AES encryption
   - Encrypted file saved to `data/encrypted/` directory

4. **Options**
   - Choose to delete original unencrypted file
   - Keep original for backup purposes

#### File Decryption Workflow

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Must be authenticated with the same face used for encryption
   - Have encrypted file available

2. **Select Encrypted File**
   - Click "üîì Decrypt File"
   - Browse to encrypted file (usually in `data/encrypted/`)
   - Select `.encrypted` file

3. **Decryption Process**
   - System uses facial features to derive decryption key
   - File is decrypted and restored to original format
   - Choose location to save decrypted file

4. **Success**
   - Original file content restored
   - Save to desired location

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Camera Problems
- **Camera won't open**: Check if other applications are using the camera
- **No image in preview**: Restart the application and try again
- **Poor image quality**: Improve lighting conditions

#### Face Detection Issues
- **No face detected**: Ensure face is clearly visible and well-lit
- **Multiple faces detected**: Only one person should be in camera view
- **Face too small/large**: Adjust distance from camera

#### Authentication Failures
- **Face doesn't match**: Re-enroll if lighting conditions have changed significantly
- **Low confidence**: Ensure similar positioning and lighting as during enrollment
- **Repeated failures**: Clear enrollment and start fresh

#### File Operation Errors
- **Encryption fails**: Check file permissions and available disk space
- **Decryption fails**: Ensure file was encrypted with the same enrolled face
- **Wrong key error**: Re-authenticate and try again

### Error Messages

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "Could not open camera" | Camera unavailable | Close other camera apps, restart |
| "No face detected" | Face not visible | Improve lighting, position face clearly |
| "Authentication failed" | Face doesn't match | Re-enroll or adjust positioning |
| "File not found" | Missing encrypted file | Check file path and permissions |
| "Decryption failed" | Wrong key/corrupted file | Verify face authentication |

### Performance Optimization

#### System Requirements
- **Minimum**: 4GB RAM, dual-core processor, basic webcam
- **Recommended**: 8GB RAM, quad-core processor, HD webcam
- **Optimal**: Good lighting, high-quality camera, fast SSD

#### Tips for Better Performance
- Close unnecessary applications before use
- Ensure stable lighting conditions
- Use external webcam for better quality
- Keep face templates backed up securely

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- **Local Storage**: All biometric data stored locally on your device
- **Encryption**: Face templates encrypted with industry-standard algorithms
- **No Transmission**: Biometric data never sent over networks
- **User Control**: Complete control over data deletion and management

### Best Practices
- **Regular Backups**: Backup encrypted files to secure locations
- **Environment Security**: Use application in private, secure environments
- **Access Control**: Limit physical access to the device
- **Regular Updates**: Keep application and dependencies updated

### Privacy Features
- **Consent Tracking**: Clear indication of data processing
- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary biometric features stored
- **Right to Delete**: Easy enrollment clearing and data removal
- **Transparency**: Open source code for security review

## Advanced Usage

### Configuration
The application uses the existing FaceAuth configuration system:

```bash
# View current settings
python main.py config-show

```

### Integration
The GUI can work alongside CLI operations:

```bash
# CLI enrollment
python main.py enroll-face username

# GUI authentication and file operations
python faceauth_gui.py
```

### Scripting
Automate GUI launch with system startup:

**Windows (PowerShell)**
```powershell
# Add to startup folder
$startup = "$env:APPDATA\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup"
