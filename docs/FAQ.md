## General Questions

### What is FaceAuth?

**Q: What is FaceAuth and what does it do?**

A: FaceAuth is a privacy-first face authentication system that allows you to secure files and authenticate using your face - completely locally on your device. Unlike cloud-based solutions, FaceAuth:

- Processes all data locally (never uploads anything)
- Uses military-grade encryption (AES-256-GCM)
- Stores only mathematical representations (not photos)
- Provides complete user control over data
- Works offline with no network dependencies

### Why choose FaceAuth over alternatives?

**Q: How is FaceAuth different from other face recognition systems?**

A: FaceAuth prioritizes privacy and security above all else:

| Feature | FaceAuth | Cloud Solutions | Other Local Solutions |
|---------|----------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Privacy** | 100% local, no data sharing | Data uploaded to cloud | Often limited privacy |
| **Security** | Military-grade encryption | Varies by provider | Basic or no encryption |
| **Control** | Complete user control | Limited user control | Moderate control |
| **Compliance** | GDPR/CCPA compliant | Varies | Usually not compliant |
| **Dependencies** | None (offline) | Internet required | May need internet |
| **Cost** | Free and open source | Subscription fees | Varies |

### Who should use FaceAuth?

**Q: Is FaceAuth suitable for my use case?**

A: FaceAuth is ideal for:

- **Privacy-conscious individuals** who want secure file storage
- **Business professionals** handling sensitive documents

- **Anyone** who values privacy and security

## Privacy & Security

### How private is my data?

**Q: What data does FaceAuth collect and where is it stored?**

A: FaceAuth collects minimal data and everything stays local:

**What we collect:**
- Face embeddings (mathematical vectors, not photos)
- Quality metrics and timestamps
- Authentication events for audit logs

**What we DON'T collect:**
- ❌ Original face photos or videos
- ❌ Personal information beyond user ID
- ❌ Device information or telemetry
- ❌ Location data
- ❌ Usage analytics

**Where it's stored:**
- Everything on your local device only
- Default location: `~/.faceauth/` (configurable)
- Encrypted with AES-256-GCM
- Protected with secure file permissions

### Can my face data be reconstructed?

**Q: Can someone recreate my face from the stored data?**

A: **No.** FaceAuth stores mathematical embeddings, not images:

- **512-dimensional vectors** representing facial features
- **Not reversible** - cannot recreate original photos
- **Abstract representation** like a mathematical fingerprint
- **Similar to how** your password is hashed, not stored

Even if someone accessed your FaceAuth files, they would only see encrypted mathematical data that cannot be converted back to your face.
