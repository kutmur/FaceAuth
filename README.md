- üîê **Secure Storage**: Military-grade encryption for face data
- üñ•Ô∏è **CLI Interface**: Simple command-line tools
- üì± **Real-time Feedback**: Live webcam preview with guidance

## ‚ö° MVP Features

- [x] **Face Registration**: Enroll users via webcam with real-time feedback
- [x] **Secure Storage**: AES-256 encrypted face embeddings with PBKDF2 key derivation
- [x] **Robust Detection**: Handle multiple faces, no face, and poor lighting conditions
- [x] **CLI Interface**: Easy-to-use command-line tools
- [ ] **Face Verification**: Real-time identity verification (coming soon)
- [ ] **File Encryption**: Encrypt/decrypt files with face authentication (coming soon)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Webcam/camera device
- Good lighting conditions for face capture

### Quick Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FaceAuth.git
   cd FaceAuth
   ```

2. **Run the setup script:**
   ```bash
   python setup.py
   ```

   Or install manually:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Verify installation:**
   ```bash
   python main.py info
   ```

## üìö Usage

### Face Enrollment

Enroll your face into the system:

```bash
# Basic enrollment
python main.py enroll-face

# With specific user ID
python main.py enroll-face --user-id john_doe

# Using different AI model
python main.py enroll-face --user-id alice --model ArcFace
```

**Enrollment Process:**
1. **Camera Setup**: The system accesses your webcam
2. **Face Detection**: Real-time feedback guides you to position your face correctly
3. **Quality Check**: Ensures single face with good lighting
4. **Capture**: Takes a high-quality image when you press SPACE
5. **AI Processing**: Generates face embedding using deep learning
6. **Secure Storage**: Encrypts and saves your face data locally

**During enrollment, you'll see:**
- ‚úÖ **Green rectangle**: Face detected and positioned correctly
- ‚ùå **Red rectangle**: Issues detected (multiple faces, poor positioning, etc.)
- **Crosshair**: Center point for optimal face positioning
- **Instructions**: Real-time guidance and controls

### Available Commands

```bash
# Enroll a new user
python main.py enroll-face [--user-id USER] [--model MODEL]

# Verify identity (coming soon)
python main.py verify-face [--user-id USER]

# Encrypt file with face auth (coming soon)
python main.py encrypt-file --file myfile.txt

# Decrypt file with face auth (coming soon)
python main.py decrypt-file --file myfile.txt.encrypted

# System information
python main.py info

# Setup dependencies
python main.py setup

# Help
python main.py --help
```

### Supported AI Models

- **Facenet** (default): Fast and accurate, good for most users
- **ArcFace**: High accuracy, slightly slower
- **VGG-Face**: Classical approach, reliable
- **Facenet512**: Higher dimensional embeddings for maximum accuracy

## üîí Security Architecture

### Encryption Details

FaceAuth uses military-grade security practices:

1. **AES-256-GCM Encryption**: Industry standard with authentication
2. **PBKDF2 Key Derivation**: 100,000 iterations with SHA-256
3. **Random Salt**: Unique salt for each user
4. **No Password Storage**: Passwords are never saved
5. **Secure Random**: Cryptographically secure random generation

### Why Face Reconstruction is Impossible

Face embeddings are mathematical vectors that represent abstract facial features:

- **Not Images**: Embeddings are numerical arrays, not visual data
- **One-Way Process**: Cannot be converted back to images
- **Abstract Features**: Represent mathematical relationships, not physical appearance
- **Model-Specific**: Would require the exact same neural network architecture
- **Missing Data**: Original training data would be needed for any reconstruction

Even if someone decrypts your face data, they only get a list of numbers that represent mathematical relationships between facial features‚Äînot your actual face.
