## üìö Usage

### Face Enrollment

Enroll your face into the system:

```bash
# Basic enrollment
python main.py enroll-face

# With specific user ID
python main.py enroll-face --user-id john_doe

# Using different AI model
python main.py enroll-face --user-id alice --model ArcFace
```

**Enrollment Process:**
1. **Camera Setup**: The system accesses your webcam
2. **Face Detection**: Real-time feedback guides you to position your face correctly
3. **Quality Check**: Ensures single face with good lighting
4. **Capture**: Takes a high-quality image when you press SPACE
5. **AI Processing**: Generates face embedding using deep learning
6. **Secure Storage**: Encrypts and saves your face data locally

**During enrollment, you'll see:**
- ‚úÖ **Green rectangle**: Face detected and positioned correctly
- ‚ùå **Red rectangle**: Issues detected (multiple faces, poor positioning, etc.)
- **Crosshair**: Center point for optimal face positioning
- **Instructions**: Real-time guidance and controls

### Available Commands

```bash
# Enroll a new user
python main.py enroll-face [--user-id USER] [--model MODEL]

# Verify identity (coming soon)
python main.py verify-face [--user-id USER]

# Encrypt file with face auth (coming soon)

### Supported AI Models

- **Facenet** (default): Fast and accurate, good for most users
- **ArcFace**: High accuracy, slightly slower
- **VGG-Face**: Classical approach, reliable
- **Facenet512**: Higher dimensional embeddings for maximum accuracy

## üîí Security Architecture

### Encryption Details

FaceAuth uses military-grade security practices:

1. **AES-256-GCM Encryption**: Industry standard with authentication
2. **PBKDF2 Key Derivation**: 100,000 iterations with SHA-256
3. **Random Salt**: Unique salt for each user
4. **No Password Storage**: Passwords are never saved
5. **Secure Random**: Cryptographically secure random generation

### Why Face Reconstruction is Impossible

Face embeddings are mathematical vectors that represent abstract facial features:

- **Not Images**: Embeddings are numerical arrays, not visual data
- **One-Way Process**: Cannot be converted back to images
- **Abstract Features**: Represent mathematical relationships, not physical appearance
- **Model-Specific**: Would require the exact same neural network architecture
- **Missing Data**: Original training data would be needed for any reconstruction

Even if someone decrypts your face data, they only get a list of numbers that represent mathematical relationships between facial features‚Äînot your actual face.

**Made with ‚ù§Ô∏è for privacy and security**

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Privacy

### Our Core Philosophy: Your Data, Your Machine

**FaceAuth is built on an unwavering commitment to privacy.** Your biometric data never leaves your computer. Period.

We believe your face is your most personal identifier, and it should remain under your complete control. That's why FaceAuth operates entirely offline, with zero cloud dependencies, no network calls, and no third-party data sharing. Your privacy isn't a feature‚Äîit's our foundation.

### What Data Is Stored?

FaceAuth creates only two types of data files on your computer:

1. **Face Data File** (`[user_hash]_face.dat`)
   - Contains your encrypted face embedding (mathematical representation)
   - Stored in the `face_data/` directory where you run FaceAuth
   - File size: Typically 2-8 KB (tiny!)

2. **Encrypted Files** (`<filename>.faceauth`)
   - Your original files encrypted with face authentication
   - Created only when you choose to encrypt files
   - Stored wherever you specify (same directory by default)

### How Is Your Data Secured?

**üî¨ Face Embedding Process:**
Your face is never stored as a picture. Instead, FaceAuth uses advanced AI to convert your face into a "face embedding"‚Äîa mathematical code made of numbers that represents the unique patterns of your facial features. Think of it like a numerical fingerprint that can't be turned back into a photo.

**üîê Military-Grade Encryption:**
- Your face embedding is encrypted using AES-256-GCM (the same encryption used by governments and banks)
- Your password is your master key‚Äîwe use it to encrypt your face data and protect your files
- Each file gets its own unique encryption key for maximum security
- We use PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations to make password attacks extremely difficult

**üîë Zero Password Storage:**
We never store your password anywhere. It exists only in your computer's memory when you're using it, then it's gone. This means even if someone gets your encrypted files, they can't access them without your password.

### What Data Is NEVER Stored or Sent?

We want to be crystal clear about what FaceAuth will never do:

- ‚ùå **Never store raw images of your face** - Only mathematical embeddings
- ‚ùå **Never store your password** - Only derived encryption keys
- ‚ùå **Never send data over the internet** - Zero network activity
- ‚ùå **Never connect to the cloud** - Everything runs locally
- ‚ùå **Never share data with third parties** - No external services
- ‚ùå **Never log your biometric data** - Privacy by design

### Where Is Your Data Stored?

All FaceAuth data is stored right on your computer in the directory where you run the application:

```
your-faceauth-folder/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ face_data/                    # Encrypted face embeddings
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [hash]_face.dat          # Your encrypted face data
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ document.pdf.faceauth         # Your encrypted files (optional)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sensitive.txt.faceauth        # Created only when you encrypt files
```

**Key Points:**
- No hidden files or system-wide storage
- No registry entries or system modifications
- You can backup, move, or delete everything yourself
- Complete transparency in data location

### How Secure Is This Really?

**üõ°Ô∏è Cryptographic Strength:**
- **AES-256-GCM**: Used by the U.S. government for TOP SECRET information
- **PBKDF2**: Industry standard for password security (100,000 iterations)
- **Authenticated Encryption**: Detects if anyone tampers with your files

**üîç Face Reconstruction Prevention:**
Face embeddings are mathematical abstractions that cannot be reversed into images. Even if an attacker:
- Decrypts your face data
- Has advanced technical skills
- Uses powerful computers

They would only see a list of numbers like `[0.23, -0.85, 1.42, ...]` that represent abstract facial features‚Äînot your actual face.

**üîí Defense in Depth:**
1. **Layer 1**: Face embedding (not an image)
2. **Layer 2**: AES-256 encryption
3. **Layer 3**: Password-based key derivation
4. **Layer 4**: No network exposure
5. **Layer 5**: Local-only processing

### Privacy Compliance

FaceAuth is designed to comply with privacy regulations:

- **GDPR**: All processing is local with explicit user consent
- **CCPA**: No data sale or sharing (impossible‚Äîit never leaves your device)
- **BIPA**: No biometric data storage without user control
- **PIPEDA**: Privacy by design principles throughout

### Third-Party Dependencies

FaceAuth uses these trusted, security-focused libraries:
- **OpenCV**: Open-source computer vision (local processing only)
- **DeepFace**: Face recognition framework (runs locally)
- **Cryptography**: Python's gold-standard crypto library
- **NumPy**: Mathematical operations

All dependencies run locally‚Äînone make network connections for FaceAuth operations.
