## Production Notes

### Technical Requirements
- **Lighting**: Ensure face is well-lit during webcam segments
- **Audio**: Consider adding background music or keeping silent for GIF
- **Timing**: Each command should have 1-2 second pause for readability
- **Text Size**: Terminal font should be large enough to read in compressed format

### Editing Guidelines
- **Transitions**: Smooth cuts between scenes, no fancy effects needed
- **Speed**: Can be slightly sped up (1.2x-1.5x) for GIF format
- **Quality**: Balance file size vs. quality for web deployment
- **Captions**: Add clear, readable captions for key moments

### Accessibility
- **Color Contrast**: Ensure good contrast in terminal
- **Text Overlays**: Large, clear fonts for overlays
- **Visual Cues**: Clear indication when face detection succeeds/fails

### Alternative Versions
- **Short Version** (30-45 seconds): Focus only on enrollment + encryption
- **Technical Version** (2-3 minutes): Show more terminal output and technical details
- **Silent GIF**: Remove all audio, rely on visual cues and text overlays

### File Naming
- `faceauth_demo_full.gif` (complete workflow)
- `faceauth_demo_short.gif` (abbreviated version)
- `faceauth_demo.mp4` (video version with audio)
