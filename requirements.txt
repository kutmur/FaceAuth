# FaceAuth Production Dependencies
# Core libraries required to run the application

# Computer Vision and Face Recognition
opencv-python>=4.8.0
deepface>=0.0.79
numpy>=1.21.0

# Cryptography and Security
cryptography>=41.0.0

# CLI Framework

# Deep Learning Backend Configuration
# =================================
# 
# IMPORTANT: Choose ONE of the following TensorFlow configurations:
#
# Option 1 (RECOMMENDED): CPU-only version for easy deployment
# Smaller download (~150MB), works on all systems, no CUDA requirements
tf-keras>=2.13.0
tensorflow-cpu>=2.13.0

# Option 2: GPU-enabled version for advanced users with CUDA setup
# Larger download (~500MB+), requires NVIDIA GPU + CUDA drivers
# Uncomment the lines below and comment out tensorflow-cpu above:
# tf-keras>=2.13.0 
# tensorflow>=2.13.0

# Note: If you have a compatible NVIDIA GPU and CUDA installed,
# you can switch to the GPU version for potentially faster face processing.
# However, for most users, the CPU version provides adequate performance
# for real-time face authentication.
