# FaceAuth Production Dependencies

# =====================
# Core Functionality
# =====================
click>=8.0.0  # CLI Framework
cryptography>=41.0.0  # Encryption/Decryption

# =====================
# Computer Vision & Face Recognition
# =====================
# CRITICAL: Only opencv-python is supported. Do NOT install opencv-python-headless or opencv-contrib-python
# as they will cause the ValueError: Expected path haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml violated error.
opencv-python>=4.8.0  # Webcam and image processing - MUST be this package only
deepface>=0.0.79  # Face recognition and embedding
numpy>=1.21.0  # Array operations
scipy>=1.9.0  # Embedding comparison
Pillow>=9.0.0  # Image processing

# =====================
# Deep Learning Backend (Choose ONE TensorFlow option)
# =====================
# Option 1 (RECOMMENDED): CPU-only version for most users
tensorflow-cpu>=2.13.0
# Option 2: GPU-enabled version (requires NVIDIA GPU + CUDA)
# tensorflow>=2.13.0
# tf-keras>=2.13.0

# =====================
# IMPORTANT NOTES
# =====================
# - opencv-python-headless and opencv-contrib-python WILL BREAK the installation
# - If you encounter OpenCV errors, run: python main.py setup
# - The setup command will clean and reinstall all dependencies correctly
# - For most users, the CPU version of TensorFlow is sufficient and easier to install
