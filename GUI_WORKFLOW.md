## 🎯 Face Enrollment Workflow

### Step-by-Step Process
1. **Click "🎯 Enroll Face"**
   - Button becomes disabled to prevent multiple operations

2. **Enter User ID**
   - Dialog prompts for unique user identifier
   - Default: "default_user"
   - Can be cancelled to abort

3. **Camera Initialization**
   - Status shows "📷 Initializing Camera"
   - AI models are loaded in background
   - Webcam is prepared for capture

4. **Face Detection Phase**
   - Status shows "🔍 Face Detection Active"
   - User should position face clearly in camera view
   - Good lighting and single person required

5. **Face Capture**
   - Status shows "🎯 Capturing Face Data"
   - System captures face images automatically
   - Multiple angles may be captured for robustness

6. **AI Processing**
   - Status shows "🧠 Generating Embedding"
   - Face features are processed with selected AI model
   - Secure 512-dimensional embedding is generated

7. **Password Setup**
   - Dialog prompts for encryption password
   - Password is used to encrypt face data locally
   - **Critical**: Password cannot be recovered if lost

8. **Secure Storage**
   - Status shows "🔐 Securing Face Data"
   - Embedding is encrypted with AES-256-GCM
   - Data stored in local `face_data/` directory

9. **Success Confirmation**
   - Success dialog shows completion details
   - File path and security information displayed
   - Buttons re-enabled for next operation

### Expected Timeline
- Camera initialization: ~2-3 seconds
- Face capture: ~3-5 seconds
- AI processing: ~2-4 seconds
- Encryption & storage: ~1-2 seconds
- **Total time**: ~8-14 seconds

## 🔐 File Encryption Workflow

### Step-by-Step Process
1. **Click "🔐 Encrypt File"**
   - File dialog opens for file selection

2. **Select File**
   - Choose any file type to encrypt
   - File path displayed in status
   - Operation can be cancelled

3. **Face Verification**
   - Status shows "👤 Face Verification Required"
   - Camera activates for identity verification
   - Must match enrolled face data

4. **Identity Verification**
   - Status shows "🔍 Verifying Identity"
   - Face is compared against stored embedding
   - Real-time verification feedback

5. **Password Entry**
   - Dialog prompts for your password
   - Must match password used during enrollment
   - Used for both face data decryption and file encryption

6. **File Encryption**
   - Status shows "🔐 Encrypting File"
   - AES-256-GCM encryption applied
   - Original file remains unchanged

7. **Success**
   - Encrypted file created with `.faceauth` extension
   - Success dialog shows file location
   - Ready for next operation

### Security Features
- **Dual Authentication**: Face verification + password
- **Original Preserved**: Source file unchanged
- **Strong Encryption**: AES-256-GCM standard
- **No Cloud Upload**: Everything stays local

## 🔓 File Decryption Workflow

### Step-by-Step Process
1. **Click "🔓 Decrypt File"**
   - File dialog opens with `.faceauth` filter

2. **Select Encrypted File**
   - Choose previously encrypted file
   - Only `.faceauth` files are valid
   - File validation occurs automatically

3. **Face Verification**
   - Identical to encryption process
   - Camera activates for identity check
   - Must match enrolled user

4. **Password Entry**
   - Enter the same password used for encryption
   - Password validates against face data
   - Dual security verification

5. **File Decryption**
   - Status shows "🔓 Decrypting File"
   - AES-256-GCM decryption applied
   - Original filename and content recovered

6. **Success**
   - Decrypted file created in same location
   - Original filename restored
   - File ready for normal use

- **No Data Loss**: Original files always preserved

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Camera Not Found**: Check webcam connection and permissions
- **Face Not Detected**: Ensure good lighting and single person
- **Password Forgotten**: Face data cannot be recovered (by design)
- **File Corruption**: Encrypted files are tamper-evident

### Performance Tips
- **Good Lighting**: Natural light works best for face detection
- **Stable Position**: Keep face steady during capture
- **One Person**: Ensure only one face visible in frame
- **Clear View**: Remove glasses/hats if detection fails

## 📝 Integration Notes

### Backend Architecture
The GUI is a thin wrapper around existing CLI functionality:
- **enrollment.py**: Face capture and embedding generation
- **authentication.py**: Face verification and matching
- **file_handler.py**: File encryption and decryption
- **crypto.py**: Cryptographic operations

### Threading Model
- **Main Thread**: GUI updates and user interaction
- **Worker Threads**: Blocking operations (camera, encryption)
- **Queue Communication**: Thread-safe status updates
- **Error Propagation**: Exceptions handled gracefully

### File Management
- **Face Data**: Stored in `face_data/` directory
- **Encrypted Files**: Created with `.faceauth` extension
- **Decrypted Files**: Restored with original names
- **Temporary Files**: Cleaned up automatically

This GUI maintains the security and privacy principles of FaceAuth while providing an intuitive interface for users who prefer graphical applications over command-line tools.
