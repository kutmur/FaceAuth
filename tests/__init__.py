FaceAuth Test Suite
==================

This package contains comprehensive unit tests for the FaceAuth project.

Test Structure:
- test_crypto.py: Tests for cryptographic functions and secure storage
- test_authentication.py: Tests for face authentication and verification
- test_file_handler.py: Tests for file encryption/decryption

All tests use mocking to avoid dependencies on hardware (webcam) or 
external services, making them fast and suitable for CI/CD environments.
