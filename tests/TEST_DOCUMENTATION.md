- **Network Mock**: Simulates network conditions and failures

### Data Mocks
- **Face Embeddings**: Generated test face encodings
- **User Data**: Synthetic user profiles and consent records
- **File Data**: Test files of various types and sizes

## Test Fixtures

### Shared Fixtures (conftest.py)
- `temp_dir`: Temporary directory for test files
- `mock_face_data`: Standard face embedding data
- `sample_user_data`: User profiles for testing
- `encryption_keys`: Test encryption keys and passwords
- `camera_frames`: Simulated camera frame sequences

### Specialized Fixtures
- `enrolled_users`: Pre-enrolled user database
- `encrypted_files`: Sample encrypted test files
- `audit_logs`: Pre-populated audit log data
- `privacy_consents`: User consent configurations

## Error Testing

### Face Detection Errors
- No face detected in frame
- Multiple faces in frame
- Poor image quality (blur, lighting)
- Camera access failures
- Model loading errors

### Authentication Errors
- Wrong face presented
- User not enrolled
- Timeout conditions
- Hardware failures
- Storage corruption

### Encryption Errors
- Wrong decryption key
- File corruption scenarios
- Insufficient disk space
- Permission denied errors
- Key derivation failures

### System Errors
- Memory allocation failures
- Network connectivity issues
- Database corruption
- Configuration errors
- Resource exhaustion

## Performance Testing

### Benchmarks
- **Enrollment Time**: <2 seconds per user
- **Authentication Time**: <0.5 seconds average
- **File Encryption**: >1 MB/s throughput
- **Memory Usage**: <50MB per user
- **Concurrent Users**: Support for 100+ simultaneous operations

### Stress Tests
- Large-scale user enrollment (500+ users)
- Sustained authentication load (1000+ attempts)
- Memory leak detection
- Resource exhaustion handling
- Concurrent operation safety

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions (Recommended)
```yaml
name: FaceAuth Tests
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: 3.8
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          pip install -r requirements-test.txt
      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest --cov=faceauth --cov-report=xml
      - name: Upload coverage
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v1
```

### Local Pre-commit Hooks
```bash
# Install pre-commit
pip install pre-commit

# Set up hooks
pre-commit install

# Run manually
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Test Data Management

### Test Data Generation
- Synthetic face embeddings using random vectors
- Generated user profiles with privacy consent
- Sample files of various types and sizes
- Encrypted data with known keys

### Test Data Cleanup
- Automatic cleanup after each test
- Secure deletion of sensitive test data
- Memory zeroing for security tests
- Temporary file management

## Debugging Tests

### Common Issues
1. **Import Errors**: Ensure PYTHONPATH includes project root
2. **Permission Errors**: Run tests with appropriate file permissions
3. **Hardware Dependencies**: Ensure mock systems are properly configured
4. **Memory Errors**: Check available system memory for performance tests

### Debug Options
```bash
# Run with Python debugger
pytest --pdb

# Capture print statements
pytest -s

# Show local variables in tracebacks
pytest --tb=long

# Run specific test with debugging
pytest tests/test_authentication.py::TestFaceAuthentication::test_successful_authentication -v -s
```

## Test Maintenance

### Regular Updates
- Update test data when models change
- Refresh performance benchmarks
- Update mock systems for new features
- Maintain test documentation

### Best Practices
- Keep tests independent and isolated
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock external dependencies
- Test both success and failure cases
- Maintain good test coverage
- Document complex test scenarios

## Reporting

### Coverage Reports
```bash
# Generate HTML coverage report
pytest --cov=faceauth --cov-report=html

# View report
open htmlcov/index.html
```

### Performance Reports
```bash
# Run performance tests with detailed output
pytest tests/test_performance.py -v -s

# Generate performance benchmark report
python tests/run_tests.py --performance --report
```

### Test Summary
The test runner automatically generates:
- Test execution summary
- Coverage percentage by module
- Performance benchmark results
- Failed test details and recommendations

## Contributing

### Adding New Tests
1. Follow existing test structure and naming conventions
2. Use appropriate fixtures and mocks
3. Test both positive and negative scenarios
4. Include performance considerations
5. Update documentation
